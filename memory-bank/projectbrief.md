# Project Brief: Ideation Platform

## Overview
An AI-powered ideation and prototyping platform that helps users generate, evaluate, and refine ideas through a structured workflow. The platform uses OpenAI's GPT models to create personalized schemas and generate high-quality ideas based on user context and preferences.

## Core Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase with Edge Functions
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini via Supabase Edge Functions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

## Key Components
1. **IdeationCanvas**: Main draggable canvas interface
2. **ContextInputPanel**: Initial user input collection
3. **SchemaEditorPanel**: Schema refinement interface
4. **IdeaGenerationPanel**: AI-powered idea generation
5. **RankingPanel**: User feedback collection
6. **SchemaRefinementPanel**: Iterative schema improvement

## Recent Issue Resolved
**Frontend-Backend Sync Problem**: The server actions were not properly handling OpenAI API responses, causing data format mismatches between frontend components and backend responses.

### Root Cause
- Server actions were parsing JSON responses but not validating structure
- Frontend components expected specific data formats that weren't guaranteed
- Missing error handling for malformed API responses

### Solution Implemented
- Added robust response validation in all server actions
- Implemented fallback parsing for different response formats
- Enhanced error handling and logging for debugging
- Ensured consistent data flow between backend and frontend

## Current Status
- Server actions working correctly with OpenAI integration
- Frontend-backend synchronization issues resolved
- Application successfully loads and accepts user input
- Ready for full end-to-end testing of the ideation workflow
